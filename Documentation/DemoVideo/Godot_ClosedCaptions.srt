00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,240
Hi all. Let's take some time to look at

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,800
the Cable Models Capstone project

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,200
sponsored by Los Alamos.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,640
This project was conceived because the

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,520
work done by the New Hanford dry

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,640
retrieval effort. Work done involved use

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,440
of machinery in dangerous waste tanks.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,240
The problem is that cable management

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,320
takes an unfortunate amount of

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,360
engineering time, which can attributes to

11
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,320
a lot of inefficiencies. So our

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,520
contracts - our contacts at Los Alamos

13
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,280
are very interested in seeing simulations

14
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,200
of cable behavior.

15
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,720
The first algorithm we considered was a

16
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,120
finite element deformation. This is a

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,280
precise solution utilizing non-linear

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,920
implicit solving. The other

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,560
solver we implemented uses mass spring

20
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,800
evaluation. This is a naive approach, but

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,480
it's very fast and easy to implement.

22
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,320
It serves very well for many different

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,320
applications. The application was

24
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,600
developed using Godot 4, an open source

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,240
game engine.

26
00:00:56,687 --> 00:00:59,247
Now let's look at the program. Here's the

27
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:00,367
main scene where we can view the

28
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:02,807
structures generated. We have the ability

29
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:04,607
to view and generate these two

30
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,127
structures, mass spring and FEM

31
00:01:06,127 --> 00:01:07,847
deformation. We can change parameters

32
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:09,607
such as mass, length, and start and end

33
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:12,327
position. We can also change the

34
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:15,247
stiffness and convergence thresholds and

35
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:17,487
add external forces if we wanted to.

36
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:20,647
In the statistics panel we can see the

37
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,967
amount of time it takes to do the

38
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:23,727
computations as well as the plot

39
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:26,047
comparison differences like mean squared

40
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:28,127
error. We can also save this to a file.

41
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:31,047
To consider our project evaluation, let's

42
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:33,136
look at user testing. We had responses

43
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,144
from 5 engineers and researchers at Los

44
00:01:35,144 --> 00:01:37,594
Alamos. They gave us open-ended feedback

45
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:39,804
as well as Likert scale responses. We

46
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:41,812
also had to perform many internal checks

47
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:43,338
for stability as we developed.

48
00:01:43,726 --> 00:01:45,606
In the future, we expect this project to

49
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,886
expand to a 3D space with more intuitive

50
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:50,046
controls for forces and endpoint

51
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:51,966
placement. Collision and friction would

52
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:53,886
also be required for further research and

53
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:55,886
development. We feel that what our

54
00:01:55,886 --> 00:01:57,526
sponsors really need is a focus on

55
00:01:57,526 --> 00:01:59,366
decision-making components. We want to

56
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:01,966
develop methods to detect bad states when

57
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:04,926
managing cables. Thank

58
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:06,366
you very much and that's what we've

59
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:06,926
accomplished.
